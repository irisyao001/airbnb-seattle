Today I’m going to mining the Airbnb Seattle Data to understand the rental landscape in Seattle by quantitative analysis and data visualizations. This dataset is from Kaggle ( https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data) and running between 2016/01/02 to 2017/01/03. Below are the questions I want to solve in this analysis: 
1. Which neighborhoods have most listings? 
2. What is the cost-effective time to visit Seattle？ 
3. Which neighborhoods have both good reviews and reasonable prices?
