# Project Motivation
	For this project, I have used Airbnb Seattle data from 01/2016 to 01/2017 to undertand these questions: 
		1. Which neighborhoods have most listings? 
		2. What is the cost-effective time to visit Seattle？ 
		3. Which neighborhoods have both good reviews and reasonable prices?
		
# File Descriptions
	There is one notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions. Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.
	
# Results
	From what I have researched from the Airbnb Seattle dataset, the listings number shows an obvious increasing tendency over a whole year in 2016. March and April would be the most economical time to visit Seattle. I recommend the neighborhoods: Minor, Fremont, Adams and Primary Ridge which have lots of choices, good reviews, and affordable prices.
